A brief description of my design and approach.

- Read the text file
	- Used Scanner object to read the file
	- Utilized split() method to turn the line of text into an array
	
	- The first index is the quantity, last index is the price
	- Utilized join() and Arrays.copyOfRange() methods to get the item names


- Item Categories 
		- Basic Items
		- Imported Items
		
- Tax Rates
		- 0% on Exempted Basic Items
		- 10% on all other Basic Items
		
		- 5% on Exempted Import Items
		- 15% on all other Imported Items
		
- Classes
		- Item Class - Abstract Parent Class
		- BasicItem Class - Extends Item Class
		- ImportItem Class - Extends Item Class
		
		- ReceiptPrint Class - Individual class	
		- FileReader Class - Reads files and generate a list of updated items
		- Main Class - Main class for printing each text files to console
		
- Interface
		- TaxCalculator Interface - defines tax rates and tax methods
		- The parent Item class implements this interface
